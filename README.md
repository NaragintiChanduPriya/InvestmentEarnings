The problem statement is:
1. Enter the buying price per share
2.Enter closing price on subsequent days
3.Calculate aggregate earnings/losses after each day
4.Leave the program when the closing price is negative
5. The program stops calculating earnings/losses once a negative closing price is entered because  investment earnings are typically calculated based on positive gains.
