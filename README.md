The problem statement is:
Enter the buying price per share
Enter closing price on subsequent days
Calculate aggregate earnings/losses after each day
Leave program when closing price is negative
The program stops calculating earnings/losses once a negative closing price is entered because  investment earnings are typically calculated based on positive gains.
